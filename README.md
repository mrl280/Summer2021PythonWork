# Summer2021PythonWork

This repo contains some of the data analysis software I developed while working as a summer student at the University of Saskatchewan.

During the summer, I supported various research initiatives involving the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN; https://github.com/SuperDARN) and the Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radars (RISR; http://cedar.openmadrigal.org/). Some of this summer's main research efforts included:
- Investigating the frequency dependence of SuperDARN echoes.
- Analyzing SuperDARN echo rates in the polar cap region.
- Calibrating SuperDARN elevation angle data.
- Leveraging the cartopy library to produce various map-based plots.

Please contact me by email at mrl280@usask.ca if you have any questions about the code herein.

## Other Data Utalized

Besides data produced by SuperDARN and RISR radars, my research efforts utilized data from the following sources:
- The CHAMP Sattelite Mission: https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/champ (CHAMP PLPT data)
- Operating Missions as a Node on the Internet (OMNI): https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/ (interplanetary magnetic field data)
- LASP Interactive Solar Irradiance Data Center (LISIRD): https://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/ (sunspot and solar flux data)
